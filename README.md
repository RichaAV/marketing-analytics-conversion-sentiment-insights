# Marketing Analytics Conversion & Sentiment Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes marketing performance data to uncover trends in conversion rates, customer engagement, and customer sentiment.
The workflow integrates SQL for data cleaning, Python for sentiment analysis, and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards that visualize key business insights.

## Tools & Technologies
SQL – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation

Python (VADER Sentiment Analysis) – Analyzing customer review sentiment

Power BI – Building interactive dashboards and visual reports

## Key Steps in the Project
### Data Cleaning (SQL)

Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats

Created structured tables for products, customer journeys, engagement metrics, and reviews

### Sentiment Analysis (Python)

Used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to classify reviews into Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Mixed categories

Generated sentiment scores for deeper insight into customer perception

### Visualization & Insights (Power BI)

Designed interactive dashboards for:

Conversion Rates by month and product

Engagement Metrics (views, clicks, likes) over time

Customer Sentiment & Ratings

Highlighted high-performing and underperforming products and seasonal trends

## Key Business Insights
Conversion Trends: Highest in January (17.31%), June (12.20%), and December (11.41%); lowest in August (2.79%) and October (5.0%)

Top Products: Hockey Stick, Ski Boots, and Baseball Glove outperform with consistently high conversions

Sentiment Findings: Majority of reviews are positive, but average rating (3.69) falls below the 4.0 target, with improvement opportunities in mixed/negative feedback areas

Engagement Decline: Views and clicks drop steadily after mid-year, indicating a need to refresh content strategies
